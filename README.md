# AEC Website – Simple Figma Prototype

A simple website prototype for the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry.  
The design was created in Figma and embedded into `index.html` using an iframe.

---

## Features / Modules

The prototype includes five main modules:

- Firms directory  
- Professionals directory  
- Marketplace (rent or purchase equipment, materials, tools, etc.)  
- Job opportunities  
- Job biddings  

This project focuses on layout, navigation, and basic user interaction only.  
No backend or dynamic functionality is implemented — this is purely a design prototype.

---

## Interactions Included

The prototype demonstrates simple clickable navigation and sample flows:

- Click each module to open its page
- Marketplace: **Rentals** and **Purchase** buttons are clickable
- Firms and Professionals: only the first listed item is clickable (for demonstration purposes)
- Back and Home icons on all pages are clickable for navigation
